# OpenCV with Python 

# Course Outline
### 1. Installation
Besides installing OpenCV, we cover the installation of the following packages:

[`caer`](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/) is a *lightweight, scalable* Computer Vision library with powerful Image and Video processing operations, designed to help speed up your Computer Vision workflow.
<pre>$ pip install caer</pre>

[`canaro`](https://github.com/jasmcaus/canaro) is a Python package solely for Deep Learning models built in Keras
<pre>$ pip install canaro</pre>
